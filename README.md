# Eulers Method
A rust program to make a graph to compare Euler's Method with the Midpoint and Actual.

Euler Method is widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and finance for solving differential equations that describe dynamic systems. It is particularly useful for initial exploratory analysis and for problems where a high degree of precision is not required.

Geometrically, Euler's method approximates the curve of the solution by a series of tangent line segments. At each step, the slope of the tangent is given by the differential equation 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)f(x,y).

inputs of 0.1 for x, y and steplength with 10 steps gives a nice graph

I have commented the Rust code for you to follow through.
